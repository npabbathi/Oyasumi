# Oyasumi
Collaborative Study Project made 2021-2022

**This is my first collaborative project made** with the help of my friends William Tran and Presley Phan.

## Description
Oyasumi is a demo 2D platformer made in Unity over the course of our senior year in high school. It follows the player through a dream like world with platforming obstacles and challeneges. 
The current demo of this game features a home screen, lobby area, and level one. In level one, there is a platforming path where the player must move around to get to the end of the level and collect the story book. Using knowlege from previous projects, we were able to implement a game mechanic in which the time of day and platforms shift based on player movement in the positive vs. negative direction of the player's movement.
